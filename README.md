# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

We are tasked with creating a DataFrame summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then we'll create a visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type with multiple lines in a graph.

## Deliverable 1 - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

The above images shows the summary data by city type. We used the total rides for each city type, the total drivers for each city type and the total fares for each city type to calculate:

- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver

## Deliverable 2 - Create a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city
