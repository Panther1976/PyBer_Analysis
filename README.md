# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

We are tasked with creating a DataFrame summary of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then we'll create a visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type with multiple lines in a graph.

## Deliverable 1 - A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type

The above images shows the summary data by city type. We used the total rides for each city type, the total drivers for each city type and the total fares for each city type to calculate:

- Total Rides
- Total Drivers
- Total Fares
- Average Fare per Ride
- Average Fare per Driver

## Deliverable 2 - Create a multiple line plot that shows the total weekly of the fares for each type of city

## Deliverable 3 - PyBer Analysis

# Results

Ultimately the results tell the story of the population. Rural areas will tend to have fewer rides but higher fares (longer distance), followed by suburban areas with urban areas having the most fares but most likely lower fares per ride (shorter distances). 

# Summary

The results could be clarified more with population information but in general, rural areas are less populated than suburban areas and suburban areas are less populated that urban areas and fewer people mean fewer rides. Generally speaking, rural rides mean longer rides/higer fares, followed by suburban rides (slighly shorter distances) and urban rides (even shorter distances). However, the volume of rides is going to favor the urban drivers based on population.
